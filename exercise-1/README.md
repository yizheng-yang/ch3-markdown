# Exercise-1

As described in the [git-basics chapter](https://info201.github.io/git-basics.html), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine.

Then, in the space below, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote. When you push your changes back up to GitHub, you will see the rendered markdown file.

See `complete` branch for an example.

 _I am the bone of my sword 
 Steel is my body and fire is my blood 
 I have created over a thousand blades
 Unknown to Death,
 Nor known to Life.
 Have withstood pain to create many weapons 
 Yet, those hands will never hold anything 
 So as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works._
